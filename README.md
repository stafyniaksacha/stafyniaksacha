# hello wolrd 🌍

> I break things and sometimes fix them

### What I'm currently breaking:
- ☸️ Kubernetes clusters (orchestrating chaos)
- 🏗️ Terraform configs (infrastructure as... something)
- ⚛️ React components (Vue, je t'aime, but duty calls)
- 🪺 NestJS APIs (ba da ba ba ba, I'm lovin' it)

### 🚀 Computing history that keeps me humble:

**Apollo 11** landed on the moon with **4KB of RAM** and **72KB of ROM**. Your smartwatch has more computing power than the entire Apollo program.

**Punch cards** stored a whopping **80 bytes** per card. A single selfie today would require approximately **50,000 punch cards** stacked 16 feet high.
